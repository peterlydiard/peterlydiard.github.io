      Spitbank Fort or Spitsand Fort or Spit Sand Fort or simply Spit Fort is a sea fort built as 
      a result of the 1859 Royal Commission. The fort is one of four built as part of the 
      Palmerston Forts constructions. Located in the Solent, near Portsmouth, England, it has been 
      a Scheduled Monument since 1967.

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p class="lead">
      The four armour-plated forts were designed by Captain E. H. Stewart overseen by Assistant 
      Inspector General of Fortifications, Colonel W. F. D. Jervois. Construction started in 1867,
      and was completed in 1878, at a cost of £167,300.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
      Spitbank is smaller than the two main Solent forts, Horse Sand Fort and No Man's Land Fort. 
      Its main purpose was as a further line of defence for ships that made it past the two main 
      forts. It is 49.4 metres (162 ft) in diameter across at its base, with one floor and a 
      basement and armour plating only on the seaward side. It was originally planned to have 
      been armed with nine 10" 18-ton rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns on the seaward side, and 
      six 7" seven-ton RML guns on the landward side. However, by the time of completion the 
      plan had changed so that the seaward side received nine 12.5-inch muzzle-loading (RML) 
      guns. From 1884 more modern 12-inch breechloading guns were installed and these were in 
      service until after World War I.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
      In 1898 the role of the fort was changed to defend against light craft and the roof was 
      fitted out with two 4.7" guns and searchlights. In the early 1900s all but three original 
      large guns were removed. Minor upgrades to the smaller guns and searchlights continued 
      through the years.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
      The fort was declared surplus to requirements in 1962 and disposed of by the Ministry of 
      Defence in 1982. The fort is now privately owned and operated by AmaZing Venues under the 
      Solent Forts brand. It has 50 rooms, its own dance hall, restaurant, and was once available 
      for private functions with limited accommodation available. It was the venue for the 
      Coalition Festival in the summer of 2009, and other psytrance and hard dance parties.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
      In 2009 it was put on sale for £800,000 but was sold before auction, reportedly 
      for more than £1m.
    </p>
  
    <p class="lead">
      Spitbank, as of April 2012, is owned by Clarenco LLP (owners of Horse Sand Fort and No 
      Man's Land Fort), and has been renovated for use as a luxury spa hotel and retreat with 
      nine bedroom suites.
