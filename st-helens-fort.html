    <p class="lead">
      St Helens Fort is a sea fort in the Solent close to the Isle of Wight, one of the Palmerston 
      Forts near Portsmouth. It was built as a result of the Royal Commission on the Defence of 
      the United Kingdom of 1859, in order to protect the St Helens anchorage.

    <h2 class="subheading">History</h2>

    <p class="lead">
      The fort was designed by Captain E. H. Stewart, overseen by Assistant Inspector General of 
      Fortifications, Colonel W. F. D. Jervois. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 
      1878, at a cost of £123,311. It suffered badly from subsidence which forced many changes 
      to the plans, ending up with two 10-inch 18-ton rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns to 
      landward and one 12.5-inch 38-ton RML gun to seaward.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
      The other sea forts, all larger, are Spitbank Fort, Horse Sand Fort and No Man's Land Fort. 
      The Solent Forts - often known as "Palmerston's Follies" - were built in response to a 
      French invasion scare under Louis Napoleon III. This was due in part to the doctrines of 
      the Jeune École of French naval thinking, which emphasised attacking ports with small 
      craft, instead of fleet action, as well as the launch of the first ironclad warship, the 
      Gloire. The threat of war with France receded after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71 
      ended in French defeat.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      The forts were later used for defence in the World Wars, although the heavier armaments 
      proved unpopular with local householders due to the concussion breaking windows during 
      firing practice. Subsequently their main useful role has been as navigational lighthouses.
    </p>
        
    <p class="lead">
      The fort is now in private hands and not open to the public. It was offered for sale in 2003. 
      Any private resident would not have access to local authority services, although it has its 
      own artesian well.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
      Periodically (often in August), on one of the lowest tides of the year, there is a mass 
      walk from St Helens beach out to the fort and back. At this day the causeway appears from 
      the sea upon which the original materials were carried out from the shore at St Helen's 
      Old Church, where there was formerly a quarry. Access is from this point, but also along 
      the spit from Bembridge. It has become traditional to hold a barbecue on the beach 
      thereafter. This event is entirely spontaneous but safety boat services are provided by 
      local yacht clubs.
